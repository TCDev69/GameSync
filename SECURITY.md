## Reporting a vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in GameSync, please **do not** open a public GitHub issue with exploit details.

1. Open a [private security advisory](https://github.com/TCDev/GameSync/security/advisories/new) on this repository, **or**
2. Contact the maintainer through GitHub (profile: [TCDev](https://github.com/TCDev)).

Include steps to reproduce, affected version, and impact if known. You should receive a response within a reasonable time.

## Scope

In scope:
